# 🩺 An EfficientNet-Based Framework for Automated Skin Lesion Diagnosis  
## With Clinical and Patient-Centric Report Generation

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common and dangerous diseases worldwide, where early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment. Manual analysis of dermoscopic images is challenging due to visual similarity between lesion types, noise, hair artifacts, illumination variations, and dependence on expert knowledge.

This project presents an **end-to-end AI-based system** for **automated skin lesion diagnosis** using **deep learning**, **lesion segmentation**, **explainable AI (Grad-CAM)**, and **GPT-based report generation**.  
The system is designed to assist both **doctors and patients** by providing accurate predictions along with transparent and understandable explanations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate detection and classification of skin lesions from dermoscopic images  
- Improve diagnostic accuracy using lesion segmentation  
- Provide explainable predictions using Grad-CAM heatmaps  
- Generate clinical reports for doctors and simplified reports for patients  
- Build a real-world, deployable AI-based healthcare solution

## 🧠 System Architecture

The proposed framework consists of the following components:

### 1. Image Preprocessing
- Noise removal  
- Hair artifact removal  
- Illumination and contrast normalization  

### 2. Lesion Segmentation
- Separates lesion region (ROI) from background skin  
- Helps the classifier focus on the affected area  
- Improves overall classification accuracy  

### 3. Skin Lesion Classification
- EfficientNet-based Convolutional Neural Network  
- Extracts discriminative features such as color, texture, and shape  
- Classifies lesions into multiple disease categories with confidence scores  

### 4. Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)
- Generates heatmaps highlighting important image regions  
- Improves model transparency and trust  
- Helps doctors understand why a prediction was made  

### 5. GPT-Based Report Generation
- **Doctor Report**: diagnostic reasoning, confidence score, and risk level  
- **Patient Report**: simple, non-technical explanation of the result  

### 6. Final Output
- Predicted disease class  
- Confidence score  
- Segmentation mask  
- Grad-CAM heatmap  
- Downloadable medical and patient-friendly reports
