For \\nexample, some people call any raised lesion a ‘blister’ but do not mean \\na bump filled with clear fluid, and people may use the word ‘scar’ to \\ndescribe post-  inflammatory pigmentation without any dermal damage. \\neven ‘sunburn’ means different things to different people. Some people \\nuse this term to describe getting a suntan.\\nSometimes the rash will have changed or even disappeared, and you \\nwill have nothing but the patient’s description to help you make a diag -\\nnosis, so the description should be as accurate as possible (see Box 2.1). \\nThe patient may bring photographs to clinic.\\nGetting on\\xa0the same wavelength\\nClarify the patient’s preconceptions about the cause of the problem, as \\nwell as their expectations of the consultation and your role.

Urticaria is commoner in atopics.\\nAcute urticaria may be triggered by drugs, e.g. penicillin, or foods, e.g. \\npeanuts, fish. The patient can often identify the allergen. In contrast, it \\nis difficult to pinpoint the trigger in most patients with chronic urticaria. \\nPhysical urticarias can be triggered by firm pressure (dermographism), \\nheat, cold, sun, or exercise.\\nThe wheals of urticaria are 2° to dermal oedema. They are raised, \\nsmooth, erythematous, and usually itchy. Angio-  oedema implies oedema \\nof the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissues, as well as mucosal and \\nsubmucosal oedema. Patients describe the sudden onset of large ten -\\nder swellings involving the skin, mucosae, and submucosal tissues (see  \\nE Chapter\\xa05, pp. 104–5, and Chapter\\xa011, p. 228 and pp. 230–1).\\nThe history should be directed at finding out exactly what happened to \\nconfirm the diagnosis of urticaria and/  or angio-  oedema, as the rash may \\nnot be present when you see the patient (see Boxes 2.4 and 2.5). Does \\nthe patient have one or both problems? • rarely, angio-  oedema can be \\ncaused by a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (inherited or acquired), \\nbut these patients do not have urticaria (see E p. 104).\\nPrick testing may be helpful to investigate the cause in some cases of \\nacute urticaria, particularly if there is a history suggesting food allergy, \\nbut such testing is unlikely to be helpful in chronic urticaria.\\nIrritant contact dermatitis or type IV hypersensitivity\\nDermatitis (eczema) caused by an external agent is known as contact \\ndermatitis. Contact dermatitis may be irritant or, less often, allergic.\\nIrritant contact dermatitis is caused by chronic exposure to irritants \\n(wet work, detergents, chemicals) and is commonest in individuals with \\natopic eczema who already have an inadequate skin barrier.\\nAllergic contact dermatitis is a type IV hypersensitivity. The patient has \\nto be sensitized by prior exposure to the allergen, sometimes for months \\nor years, before the onset of allergy. The eczematous response is maxi -\\nmal 5–  7\\xa0days after exposure to the allergen. Allergic contact dermatitis \\nis less common in children than in adults. Irritant contact dermatitis is \\ncommoner than allergy.\\nIf you suspect an allergic contact dermatitis, direct your history \\ntowards elucidating the cause (see Box 2.6) by exploring the relationship \\nof the rash to activities (work, hobbies). Patch testing is the investigation \\nof choice (see E Chapter\\xa010, pp. 214–16).\\nA 2° allergic contact dermatitis may complicate the picture in an indi -\\nvidual with long-  standing dermatitis of another type, particularly when \\nmany different medicaments or over-  the-  counter preparations have \\nbeen used over a prolonged period.

It will help if the patient can show you the \\npreparations being used—  they may not be what you think were \\nprescribed!\\n• When, where, and how is the preparation applied? Ask open \\nquestions to find out exactly what the patient is doing:\\xa0‘Tell me more \\nabout how you use your treatment’.\\n• How much is being applied, and how often? Underuse is common.\\n• Steroid phobia is a common cause of treatment failure. How long \\ndoes the 30g or 100g tube of steroid ointment last? Some parents \\nmay be very reluctant to apply topical steroids to their child’s \\neczematous skin (see E pp. 608–9).\\n• e mollients should be used liberally and frequently. Was the patient \\ngiven a 500g\\xa0tub?\\n• It can be particularly confusing for the patient if several topical \\npreparations were prescribed. Are they to be used at the same time \\nor sequentially; all over the skin or just on localized\\xa0areas?\\n• Has anyone shown the patient how to use the treatment? There is \\na knack to applying topical medicaments. Ideally, all patients with \\nchronic skin problems would see a dermatology nurse. The nurse can \\nanswer questions, explain (again) what the treatment is likely to do, \\nand show the patient (or carer) how to use the treatments. If you do \\nnot have access to a dermatology nurse, you should be prepared to \\ndemonstrate the treatments yourself.'),\n",

They may also have the erroneous \\nperception that the ointment does not ‘get into the skin’. The \\nanswer may be to use an ointment in the evenings and a cream in \\nthe daytime.\\n• Some people find the skin is itchier under an occlusive ointment \\nthan under a\\xa0cream.\\n• Preservatives in creams can sting inflamed skin or cause transient \\nerythema. People who misinterpret these problems as a sign of \\n‘allergy’ will stop the treatment.\\n• Was the patient prescribed enough of the preparation?

If we think that we ‘look good’, we are more likely to ‘feel good’ \\nand have confidence.\\nThe psychosocial and physical impact of highly visible inflammatory skin \\ndiseases, such as psoriasis, acne, or atopic eczema, may be profound. \\nSkin diseases disrupt school, work, and social life. Low self-  esteem, com -\\nmon in teenagers with acne, may affect personal relationships, as well as \\nprospects of employment. Inherited skin diseases, such as epidermolysis \\nbullosa ( eB), may be even more devastating. Patients, their families, and \\nfriends may find it difficult to\\xa0cope.\\nPatients with chronic scaly skin conditions may also have a deep- \\nseated, and probably quite irrational, fear of being contagious. ‘I feel \\nlike a leper’. This may be reinforced by the reaction of family and/  or \\nfriends who have an equally deep-  seated fear of ‘catching something’. \\nThe patient withdraws from physical and social contact.\\nSkin conditions in patients with other medical problems may be the \\n‘last straw’, e.g. the intractable itching in chronic liver or renal failure \\nwhich can be more difficult to control than pain; photosensitivity in dis -\\neases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SL e), which may have a \\nmajor impact on normal daily activities; hair loss or pigmentary changes \\nwhich may be disabling; and highly visible adverse effects of drugs (see \\nE\\xa0pp. 372–91) or the result of conditions such as chronic graft-  versus- \\nhost disease ( gVHD) (see E pp. 534–6).\\nQuality of\\xa0life\\nConsider measuring quality of life objectively, using a validated ques -\\ntionnaire such as the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) ( M www.\\ncardiff.ac.uk/  dermatology/ quality- of- life/ dermatology-  quality- of- life- \\nindex- dlqi/ ) (see Boxes 2.13 and 2.14). This tool will give you insight into \\npatients’ perceptions of the impact of their skin conditions on their lives \\nand also help you to assess the effectiveness of interventions such as edu -\\ncation, counselling, and, of course, treatment. The reaction of patients \\nis not predictable and sometimes may seem out of proportion to the \\nseverity of the skin disease. The DLQI provides insight into that reaction.\\nThe DLQI is self-  explanatory and is designed for patients over the age \\nof 16\\xa0years. It can be handed to the patient before the consultation and \\ntakes 1 or 2min to complete. A\\xa0similar questionnaire has been validated \\nfor use in children.

Ten percent of people with psoriasis \\nhave had suicidal thoughts. Some patients become increasingly intro -\\nspective, isolated, and depressed. Treatments prescribed for the skin \\ncondition, such as systemic corticosteroids, can also affect\\xa0mood.\\nBut anxiety or depression may be quite unrelated to skin disease, and \\nthe potential link between the mood change and the skin problem should \\nbe explored in the history.\\nDysmorphophobia and dermatological non-  disease\\neach of us has a clear idea of how we look, but some individuals have a \\ndistorted body\\xa0image.\\nDysmorphophobia (body dysmorphic disorder) is a psychiatric condi -\\ntion in which patients have an unshakeable belief that they have a major \\nflaw in their appearance. If present, the lesion is trivial, but some patients \\nhave no visible pathology (dermatological non-  disease). Most patients \\nlack insight into their behaviour but want a dermatological answer to the \\nintractable problem.\\nBefore diagnosing dysmorphophobia or dermatological non-  disease, it \\nis important to be clear what the patient is describing and what they are \\ndoing to their skin, e.g. picking may scar the skin, hair plucking induces \\nfolliculitis. Many inflammatory skin conditions do fluctuate in severity, \\nand some, such as urticaria, may disappear completely.\\nAsk the patient to grade the skin problem as it is today, with 10 being \\nthe worst possible and zero being normal skin. If the patient says it is \\ndreadful and gives the problem a grade of 10, yet you can see no gross \\npathology, it is likely that your patient is delusional (see E p. 570).\\nDelusions of\\xa0parasitosis\\nThe patient believes that he/  she is infested and quite often will have con -\\nvinced other members of the family that this is the case. He/  she may \\ndescribe a crawling or biting sensation, lumps on the skin, and digging out \\nthe ‘parasites’ to provide relief. You may be given a bag or box containing \\nspecimens of these ‘parasites’ (fragments of skin scale, crust, or hair).

Ensure \\nthe patient is warm and comfortable. You will need to expose the skin, \\nbut you can do this in stages, so have a sheet or blanket to hand so that \\nyou can cover the patient. Ask if the skin is tender before you\\xa0begin.\\nRemember to examine the nails, scalp, hair, and mucous membranes, \\nas well as the skin. Look under dressings, and invite patients to remove \\nmake-  up, dentures, or wigs. You may need a chaperone, particularly if \\nyou are going to examine sensitive areas such as the genitalia. You may \\nalso need a nurse to help you with dressings.\\nCan you\\xa0see?\\nLighting in most clinical areas is inadequate for examining the skin. Ideally, \\nyou should be working in bright ambient lighting that is equivalent to day -\\nlight, and you should have access to mobile supplementary illumination \\nfor some tasks, e.g. inspecting inside the mouth or illuminating awkward \\nskinfolds.\\nMagnification\\nSome dermatologists use a hand lens or magnifying loupes for close inspec-\\ntion of skin lesions. Magnification can also help to assess the small blood \\nvessels in the nail folds—  you can use an ophthalmoscope with a drop of \\nimmersion oil, but a dermatoscope is even better. A\\xa0dermatoscope can \\nalso confirm the diagnosis of scabies by revealing mites in burrows. A der -\\nmatoscope is used for assessing pigmented lesions, but it takes expertise \\nto interpret the signs (see E p. 640).\\nWood light (black\\xa0light)\\nA Wood light emitting UVR in the long-  wave UVA region may be used \\nin the assessment of hypo-  or hyperpigmentation or some cutaneous \\ninfections (see E p. 640).\\nRecording the\\xa0signs\\nDraw pictures, or use a body map, to show the distribution of any rash \\nor tumours (see Fig. 3.1).

Herpes zoster involves the skin in a dermatomal pattern (see  \\nE\\xa0p. 156–7 and Fig.\\xa04.2, pp. 64–5).\\nEmbryonic ventral axial\\xa0line\\nthe embryonic ventral axial line marks the border between the C5/  C6 \\nand C8/  t1/ t2 dermatomes. t here is no crossover of sensory nerves \\nor sensory function along this line that separates the cranial and caudal \\ndermatomes. Contiguous dermatomes on either side of the ventral axial \\nline are supplied from discontinuous spinal cord segments:\\xa0C5 and C6 \\ndorsal; and C8, t 1, and t2 ventral (see Fig.\\xa04.2, pp. 64–5).\\nSome morbilliform drug eruptions show a sharp ‘drug line’ that cor -\\nresponds to this axial line, with well-  demarcated involvement of the t 1, \\nt2, t3 spinal nerve dermatomes, but sparing of the adjacent C5 nerve \\ndermatome.\\nPigmentary demaration lines (Voigt–  Futcher\\xa0lines)\\n(see E Box 1.5, p. 13.)\\nthe demarcation between darker dorsal and paler ventral surfaces is \\napparent in about 20% of people with dark skin.

But cutaneous tumours \\nare common, and you need to ‘get your eye in’, so you know when to \\nrefer. For more information, see E Chapter\\xa0 17, pp. 341–63. t hese \\npointers may be helpful:\\n• Patients with fair skin who burn in the sun are at greatest risk \\nof skin cancers. Chronic immunosuppression with drugs, such \\nas azathioprine, or chronic photosensitivity greatly increase the \\nchances of developing skin cancer (see E p. 346).\\n• Most skin cancers grow slowly, an important exception being \\nnodular malignant melanoma.\\n• BCCs and malignant melanomas are usually painless, but some \\nSCCs may be tender, particularly on the\\xa0ear.\\n• Most malignant melanomas arise de novo, and not from a pre- \\nexisting melanocytic naevus.\\n• Carry out a skin check in all patients. Examine sun-  exposed skin on \\nthe face, bald scalp, ears, forearms, and back of the hands. Look at \\nthe skin on the back and legs, and check behind the\\xa0ears.\\n• Look for signs of chronic sun damage, e.g. mottled pigmentation, \\ntelangiectasia, yellowing, wrinkling, and keratoses (see E Box\\xa03.1, \\np. 43). the more sun damage, the greater the likelihood of \\ndeveloping a skin cancer—  eventually.\\n• Remember deeply tanned skin is generally unhappy\\xa0skin!\\n• Solar keratoses are common and do not need treatment, unless the \\nkeratosis is thickened (indurated) when you should suspect an SCC. \\nBut solar keratoses do indicate too much sun exposure, and you \\nshould advise your patient accordingly.\\n• Put the skin on the stretch to see the pearly border of a BCC (the \\ncommonest skin cancer).\\n• t hink again before you diagnose melanocytic naevus in an elderly \\npatient. Benign melanocytic naevi, common in youth, gradually \\nregress with age. a\\xa0pigmented tumour in an elderly patient is much \\nmore likely to be a seborrhoeic wart (raised, well-  defined margin, \\n‘stuck- on’ appearance, rough with a pitted, crinkled surface) or a \\nsolar lentigo (flat, smooth, even pigmentation), but it just might be a \\nmalignant melanoma.\\n• Use the aBCDE criteria (see E p. 354) to assess the likelihood of \\nany pigmented lesion being a malignant melanoma, and remember \\nto look twice at moles that stand out from their neighbours—  the \\n‘ugly ducklings’.\\n• Record your findings, including the presence of sun damage and the \\nfact that you carried out a skin\\xa0check.\\n• a dvise patients how to protect their skin from sun damage to \\nminimize the risk of skin cancer. But temper your advice with a \\nlittle common sense—  we all need some sun to lift our spirits and \\nmaintain our vitamin D levels! (See E pp. 346 –7.)'),\n",

Infection is unlikely if the tick is attached \\nfor <48h.

The disease is endemic in tropical, sub -\\ntropical, and southern European countries, including Central and South \\namerica, a sia, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and East and North \\nafrica. a nimal reservoir hosts include rodents, bats, wolves, and foxes. \\nBites of ♀ sandflies transmit the parasite to humans.\\nCutaneous leishmaniasis is the commonest type of leishmaniasis (see \\nBox 8.9). p resentation is determined by infectivity and virulence of the \\nparasite and the host response—  some species induce a brisk inflamma -\\ntory response, while others produce a more indolent disease.\\nWhat should I\\xa0look\\xa0for?\\n• a\\xa0history of travel to an endemic region:\\xa0the average incubation time \\nis about 2\\xa0months, but cutaneous leishmaniasis may not present for \\nmore than a year after the sandfly\\xa0bite.\\n• a\\xa0history of sandfly bites (patients may not be aware of bites).\\n• Lesions on nocturnally exposed skin:\\xa0face, neck,\\xa0arms.\\n• One or more painless brownish nodules that may resemble bites, but \\nusually do not itch, and slowly enlarge into plaques or warty lesions \\n(Old World disease), or boil-  like erythematous nodules that crust \\ncentrally and ulcerate in 1–  3\\xa0months (New World disease). Ulcers \\nmay expand to a diameter of\\xa03–  6cm.\\n• Satellite nodules may develop around the 1° nodule. Nodules may \\nspread along lymphatics (‘sporotrichoid spread’).\\n• Other members of the family may also have lesions, suggesting that \\nthe infection was acquired by bites at the same\\xa0time.\\nWhat should\\xa0I\\xa0do?\\n• Take one or two full-  thickness 4mm punch skin biopsies from \\nthe raised edge of a lesion or nodule for histological examination. \\nhistology is granulomatous, but, even with a Giemsa stain, \\namastigote parasites may be difficult to find. p arasite DN a can \\nbe detected in lesional material by p Cr, replacing culture in many \\ncentres.\\n• Make a smear from slit skin scrape, tissue, or aspirate (see Box 8.10). \\nparasites are easier to find in a smear than a biopsy.\\n• Culture material:\\xa0first you will need to obtain the culture medium.\\n• Serology:\\xa0usually unhelpful, because the antibody levels are\\xa0low.\\n• Discuss management with an expert. Most lesions will heal without \\ntreatment in 3–  18\\xa0months but leave a depressed scar which may be \\nvery disfiguring. p atients with New World leishmaniasis are at risk \\nof developing mucosal disease. Intralesional, IM, or IV pentavalent \\nantimony (sodium stibogluconate) is still the mainstay of treatment.'),\n",

The prevalence varies in different \\nethnic groups, but it affects around 2% of Northern Europeans. People \\nof any age are affected, and the incidence is similar in men and women. \\nSeventy-  five percent of cases occur before the age of 46, but some stud -\\nies have suggested two peaks of onset, between 16 and 22\\xa0 years and \\n57 and 60\\xa0years. The disease remits spontaneously in 1/ 3 of patients, \\nsometimes for 50\\xa0years, but the course is unpredictable.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe epidermis in psoriatic plaques is hyperproliferative, and the dermis \\ncontains tortuous, dilated small blood vessels, as well as an inflammatory \\ninfiltrate of CD4 + and CD8 + T- cells. Neutrophils are present in some \\nforms of psoriasis. Dendritic cells contribute to pathogenesis.\\nIt has been hypothesized that an antigen penetrating a defective epi -\\ndermal barrier stimulates an immune response, but, although innate and \\nadaptive immunity seem to be activated, no antigen has been identified. \\nCytokines released by epidermal keratinocytes and activated T-  cells \\ndrive new vessel formation and proliferation of keratinocytes and T-  cells. \\nT- helper 1 (Th-  1) cytokines (interferon (IFN) γ, IL- 2, and IL-  12) as well \\nas tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-  α), a pro-  inflammatory cytokine, are \\npresent in psoriatic plaques. IL-  22 and -  23 (which activate Th-  17 cells) \\nalso have a role in pathogenesis.\\nGenetic factors\\nSusceptibility to psoriasis is inherited—  about 30% of patients with pso -\\nriasis have an affected first-  degree relative. Linkage studies have shown \\nthat the genetics of psoriasis is complex (see Box 9.1). Environmental \\nfactors may trigger psoriasis in genetically predisposed individuals (see \\nBox\\xa09.3).\\nPsoriasis is more than skin\\xa0deep\\nPatients with psoriasis have an increased risk of developing other inflam -\\nmatory diseases that are immunologically mediated—  seronegative \\narthritis (psoriatic arthritis—  see E p. 206) and Crohn disease. Case \\ncontrol studies have also shown an increased prevalence of the meta -\\nbolic syndrome (see Box 9.2) in patients with psoriasis, possibly related \\nto chronic inflammation and circulating inflammatory cytokines, including \\nTNF- α. The psychosocial burden of psoriasis is considerable. Anxiety \\nand depression are common, and patients tend to smoke and drink \\ntoo much alcohol. Treat the whole patient, remembering associated \\nco- morbidities, including coeliac disease, cardiovascular disease (see \\nBox\\xa09.2 p. 191), hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, peptic ulcer, and \\nliver disease.'),\n",

Impact should be assessed with a \\ntool such as the DLQI (see E p. 32).\\nSeverity may be measured using a global rating (see Box 9.10) or with a \\ndisease-  specific tool such as the\\xa0PASI.\\nWhat is the\\xa0PASI?\\n(See Fig. 9.7.) The PASI is a tool that was devised for assessing chronic \\nplaque psoriasis. The PASI is a widely used outcome measure in clini -\\ncal trials—  a PASI 50 means that the patient shows a 50% improvement \\nfrom the baseline PASI. The PASI can be used to record the progress of \\npatients with chronic plaque poriasis. It is less useful in other forms of \\ndisease such as palmoplantar pustulosis and guttate psoriasis.\\nHow do I\\xa0interpret the\\xa0PASI?\\n• Higher scores indicate more severe psoriasis.\\n• Although the PASI ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (100% coverage \\nin the worst possible psoriasis), in practice, a PASI of 12 or more \\nindicates severe chronic plaque psoriasis, and a PASI of <7 indicates \\nmild chronic plaque psoriasis.\\nHow is the\\xa0PASI calculated?\\n(See Fig.\\xa09.7.)\\n• The body is divided into four anatomical regions (head, upper limbs, \\ntrunk, lower limbs).\\n• Redness (erythema), thickness (infiltration), and scaling in the \\npsoriatic plaques in each region are each scored on a 5-  point scale  \\n(0 = none; 1 = slight; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe).\\n• The area of skin affected in each region is estimated and given a \\nnumerical\\xa0value.\\n• The final calculation uses a simple formula to adjust the score for each \\nregion, according to the proportion that the skin in each region is of \\nall the\\xa0skin.\\n• The PASI will only take a few minutes to complete, once you have had \\nsome practice. PASI scoring sheets, which will take you through the \\ncalculation, are widely available. Online calculators are also available, \\ne.g. M http:/ / pasi.corti.li/  or M www.pasitraining.com/  calculator/ \\nstep_ 1.php.\\n• Although the PASI is subjective, with experience, results are reproducible.\\nBox 9.10 Global assessment\\n• Mild <5%\\xa0BSA.\\n• Moderate 5–  10%\\xa0BSA.\\n• Severe >10%\\xa0BSA.\\nMeasure the BSA using the patient’s hand.

Treatments offer control, rather than cure—  psoriasis \\nremits despite treatment, not because of treatment. y our assessment \\nshould establish the impact of the disease, efficacy of previous treat -\\nments, and the extent of the disease. Managing psoriasis is an art—  help \\nthe patient to find a balance between living with psoriasis and living with \\nproblems caused by treatment. For investigations, see Box\\xa09.11.\\nWhat should\\xa0I\\xa0do?\\n• Do not make any assumptions—  explore the patient’s expectations. \\nSome patients are very bothered by limited disease. y ou will also \\nmeet patients with extensive disease who do not want systemic \\ndrugs. Using the DLQI can\\xa0help.\\n• Address lifestyle. Lifestyle behaviour change, e.g. weight loss, \\nexercise, reduced alcohol intake, can be helpful.\\n• Explain treatments control, but do not cure, psoriasis.\\n• Does the patient want treatment? No treatment is an option— \\npsoriasis may scar the mind, but it does not scar the\\xa0skin.\\n• Find out what the patient can manage to do him/  herself.\\n• Keep the treatment simple. Decide whether to recommend topical \\ntreatments, UV light, or a systemic drug, or to use a combination.\\n• Discuss the likely benefits (including how long it will take, before \\ntreatment has an effect), and explain the side effects of treatments.\\n• Negotiate a plan for management, provide a written management \\nplan, and agree follow-  up arrangements (see E pp. 30–1).\\n• Provide information about psoriasis, including patient support groups \\nsuch as the Psoriasis Association (UK)—  available at M https:/ / www.\\npsoriasis-  association.org.uk/ .\\nTopical treatment\\nsee E pp. 204–5.\\nPhototherapy\\xa0(UVB)\\nPatients with widespread psoriasis, including guttate psoriasis, may ben -\\nefit from a 6-  to 8-  week course of phototherapy with UVB x3/ week \\n(narrow band 311nm). UVB may be combined with topical vitamin D 3 \\nanalogues, tazarotene, or systemic treatments (retinoids). Sunbeds emit \\nUVA, which is much less effective than UVB and significantly increase the \\nrisk of melanoma and non-  melanoma skin cancers.\\nSystemic treatment\\n(See Box 9.12.) Methotrexate (weekly dose), oral retinoids (acitretin), \\nand ciclosporin are the most widely used drugs. In patients with psoriatic \\narthritis, the choice of systemic treatment should be made in collabora -\\ntion with a rheumatologist. The new biological agents (e.g. anti-  TNF- α) \\nhave revolutionized the treatment of severe psoriasis unresponsive to \\nother treatments (see E Chapter\\xa034, and Box 34.5, p. 671).'),\n",

Irritancy is commoner than allergy. Impaired skin barrier func -\\ntion facilitates penetration of irritants and contact allergens into the epi -\\ndermis, e.g. in atopic individuals, neonates, or older patients. e xposed \\nbody sites are often affected by contact dermatitis. Occupational con -\\ntact dermatitis occurs more frequently in cleaners, hairdressers, nurses, \\nhomemakers, caterers, and builders (see Fig.\\xa010.1).\\nIrritant contact dermatitis\\nUrine and faeces are irritants—  the buttocks and perineum are affected \\nin incontinent patients (see E Chapter\\xa031, p. 604). Detergents, alkalis, \\nsolvents, and cutting oils are also potential irritants. Some plants contain \\nlight- sensitizing furocoumarin chemicals that are phototoxic in the pres -\\nence of sunlight (see E Box 16.4, p. 327).\\nAllergic contact dermatitis\\nPathogenesis:\\xa0 delayed (type 4)\\xa0 cell-  mediated allergic reaction (see \\nBox\\xa0 10.3). t he patient has to have prior exposure and sensitization \\nbefore developing an allergic reaction characterized by itching, ery -\\nthema, vesiculation, and scaling. For common cutaneous allergens, see \\nBox 10.4. Always consider patch testing in chronic hand dermatitis, facial \\ndermatitis, pruritus ani (when over-  the-  counter medicaments may have \\nbeen used), and dermatitis associated with chronic leg ulcers. Patch tests \\nare applied to the back on day 0, removed and read on day 2, and read \\nagain on day 4 or 5.\\xa0An eczematous reaction indicates a positive result.\\nWhat should\\xa0I\\xa0ask?\\n• t ake a history, as recommended in E Chapter\\xa02, pp. 20–3 and \\npp. 30–1. Ask about the occupation and hobbies; is the patient an \\nobsessive handwasher? (see E p. 566.)\\n• Find out what the patient uses—  cosmetics, perfumes, hair dyes, \\nover- the-  counter medicaments, etc. r emember you can become \\nallergic to a product that has been used for some\\xa0time.\\n• e xplore what provokes the rash. Does the problem improve when \\nnot in contact with the preparation, e.g. weekends, holidays?\\n• Is there a history of atopic eczema (irritant contact dermatitis is \\ncommoner than allergic contact dermatitis in atopics).\\nWhat should\\xa0I\\xa0do?\\n• e xclude 2° infection, particularly in genital dermatitis.\\n• Minimize contact with irritants, e.g. avoid soap, and use gloves. \\n• Prescribe emollients.\\n• r educe inflammation with a potent corticosteroid ointment. A\\xa0short \\ncourse of prednisolone may be needed in severe blistering reactions.\\n• r efer for patch testing if you suspect an allergic contact dermatitis.\\n• If the patient is allergic to something, any contact with that allergen will \\nproduce a reaction, and complete avoidance is essential.

Apoptotic basal keratinocytes release \\nmelanin into the dermis where it is taken up by macrophages. t he preva-\\nlence of autoimmune conditions, such as alopecia areata, vitiligo, and \\nulcerative colitis, is increased in LP. Some studies suggest an increased \\nprevalence of infections with hepatitis B or C virus. LP can also be \\ndrug-  induced (see E p. 375). Many variants of cutaneous LP have been \\ndescribed. Itching is a common complaint. Lichen nitidus may be a variant \\nof LP (see Box 10.6).

Urticaria erupts spontaneously, and smooth, ery-\\nthematous, itchy swellings (wheals) persist for 2– 24h, before fading to leave \\nnormal skin (see Fig. 11.1). Some patients have wheals every day; in others, it \\nis episodic. the condition may persist for <6 weeks (acute urticarial) and may \\nbe precipitated by insect bites, drugs, e.g. penicillin, infections, contact with \\nlatex, and food allergies (see E pp. 104–5). It can last for months or years \\n(chronic) (see Box 11.1). the underlying mechanism may be immunological \\nor non- immunological, but the end result is the same— mast cell degranula-\\ntion with release of histamine and inflammatory mediators, increased capil-\\nlary permeability, and transient fluid leakage into the dermis, causing swelling.\\nWhat is chronic urticaria?\\n(See Box 11.1.) In most patients with chronic urticaria, a cause is not iden -\\ntified, and it is called spontaneous (previously referred to as ordinary). \\nhelminth infections should be considered as a cause, and urticaria is also \\ncommon in SLE. Children and adolescents with severe spontaneous urti -\\ncaria have an increased prevalence of coeliac disease.\\nWhat should\\xa0I\\xa0ask?\\n• Exclude physical urticaria by asking about precipitating factors \\n(pressure, sun, heat, cold) and how long it takes urticaria to appear. \\nPatients who are dermographic may notice wheals appear immediately \\nwhen the skin is rubbed/  scratched—  wheals last <1h (see Fig. 11.2).\\n• What are the symptoms—  itch, burning,\\xa0pain?\\n• h ow long do the marks last? Delayed pressure urticaria may last up \\nto 72h. Urticarial vasculitis is also long-  lasting (see E p. 443).\\n• Is it precipitated by contact with latex or foods, e.g. fish,\\xa0nuts?\\n• What does the skin look like when urticaria fades? Skin should appear \\nnormal in urticaria. Urticarial vasculitis leaves bruising.\\n• Ask about wheezing and angio- oedema:\\xa0lip and throat swelling  \\n(see E p. 104).\\n• Is the patient taking any drugs that may cause or worsen urticaria— \\nopiates (direct mast cell-  releasing agents), salicylates, non-  steroidal \\nanti- inflammatories, ACE inhibitors? (see E p. 372.)\\n• Does the patient report symptoms suggesting an underlying systemic \\ndisease, e.g. fever, arthralgia, myalgia, diarrhoea, weight\\xa0loss?\\n• Is there a family history of urticaria? (see E pp. 234–5.)\\nWhat should\\xa0I\\xa0do?\\nsee E Management, pp. 232–3.\\n• Check the skin surface—  smooth, not scaly, in urticaria (see Fig.\\xa011.1).\\n• Confirm that the rash is erythematous (does it blanch?).\\n• Stroke the skin with a spatula to see if the patient is dermographic \\n(a\\xa0wheal and flare appear within 10min at the site of pressure).\\n• Check that the skin looks normal where wheals have\\xa0faded.\\n• Are the lips or tongue swollen?\\n• Assess using the urticarial activity score (UAS) (see Box 11.2). t his \\nhas been validated for use in follow-  up and monitoring of urticaria. \\nDue to daily variability, sum scores over 4 or 7\\xa0days to monitor.'),\n",

(see E p. 32.) \\nAcne may have a major psychosocial impact, eroding self-  confidence \\nand causing depression or even suicide.\\n• What treatment has the patient used and for how long? Most acne \\ntreatments take up to 4\\xa0months to have a maximal effect.\\n• h ow are topical preparations, such as benzoyl peroxide or topical \\nretinoids, being applied—  all over the face or trunk (as they should be) \\nor just on ‘spots’? Any adverse effects such as irritation of the\\xa0skin?\\n• Oral antibiotics—  most patients will need prolonged treatment for \\nseveral years. What does the patient mean by ‘taking a course’?\\n• What else is being applied to the skin—  greasy cosmetics or pomades?\\n• What is the patient’s occupation? Is he or she in a hot or humid \\nenvironment, working with tars or oils, or wearing a cap that \\noccludes the forehead?\\n• Is trauma irritating hair follicles (acne mechanica)—  friction under chin \\nstraps, helmets, or shoulder pads (American footballers), or repeated \\nrubbing of the face with exfoliative creams?\\n• Is the patient taking drugs that might exacerbate acne? (see E Drugs \\nand skin diseases, p. 384 and 388.)\\n• Refractory severe acne (see Box\\xa012.4).\\nWhat should I\\xa0look\\xa0for?\\n(See Figs. 12.1 and\\xa012.2.)\\n• Acne affects the face and/  or upper trunk.

Desmosomes contain transmembrane adhesion proteins \\n(desmosomal cadherins) and cytoplasmic plaque proteins. Interactions \\nbetween the extracellular portions of the transmembrane cadherins \\nhold the keratinocytes together. The cytoplasmic portion of the cad -\\nherin inserts into the desmosomal plaque where it interacts with plaque \\nproteins such as desmoplakin or plakoglobin. These plaque proteins link \\nto keratins in the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, which are linked to \\nthe nucleus. Thus the whole network is stable, and signals can be trans -\\nduced from the external surface of the cell through the desmosome to \\nthe nucleus (see Fig. 13.2a).\\nAdhesion between\\xa0basal keratinocytes  \\nand the\\xa0basement membrane\\nHemidesmosomes at the base of basal keratinocytes attach keratino -\\ncytes to the basement membrane. Hemidesmosomes, like desmosomes, \\ncontain transmembrane adhesion proteins and cytoplasmic plaque pro -\\nteins. Transmembrane hemidesmosomal proteins, such as BP antigen \\n2 BP180 (collagen XVII) and α6β4 integrin, extend into the basement \\nmembrane zone (BMZ) to interact with proteins, such as laminins, in \\nanchoring filaments to bind the epidermis to the basement membrane. \\nThe cytoplasmic portions of these transmembrane hemidesmosomal \\nproteins interact with cytoplasmic plaque proteins in the hemidesmo -\\nsome such as plectin and BP antigen 1 (BP230). As in desmosomes, these \\nplaque proteins link hemidesmosomes to the keratins of the intermedi -\\nate filament cytoskeleton, which are, in turn, connected to the nucleus \\nof the cell (see Fig. 13.2b).\\nThe basement membrane\\xa0zone\\nThe surface area of the basement membrane interface between the epi -\\ndermis and dermis is increased and adhesion enhanced by downward \\nprojections from the epidermis (epidermal rete pegs) that interdigitate \\nwith upward projections from the dermis (dermal papillae). Interactions \\nbetween laminins, collagens, and non-  collagenous proteins in the BMZ \\npromote adhesion. The lamina lucida (electron-  lucent zone) of the base -\\nment membrane, containing laminins, lies immediately beneath basal \\nkeratinocytes. Laminins attach to collagen IV in the underlying lamina \\ndensa. Fine anchoring filaments (laminin-  332, laminin-  311) bound to \\nextracellular domains of the hemidesmosomal protein α6β4 integrin \\nextend across the lamina lucida into the lamina densa where the fila -\\nments link to anchoring fibrils (collagen VII). The anchoring fibrils fasten \\nthe lamina densa to the underlying collagen bundles of the papillary der -\\nmis (see Fig. 13.2b).'),\n",

Our spirits rise in \\nthe sun, and sunny days evoke memories of long holidays (as well as revi -\\nsion for exams). But the sun has the potential to harm—  there can be ‘too \\nmuch of a good thing’. Sunburn, skin cancer, and most photosensitivity \\ndisorders are caused by\\xa0UV r.\\nHow does ultraviolet radiation affect the\\xa0skin?\\nthe sun emits a broad and continuous spectrum of electromagnetic \\nenergy (the solar spectrum) (see Fig. 16.1). UV r is divided into short \\n(UVC), medium (UVB), and long (UV a, ‘black light’) wavelength emis -\\nsions. Ninety-  eight percent of the UV r that reaches the earth’s surface \\nis UVa. all UVC and a little UVB are absorbed in the atmosphere by the \\nozone layer. UVB is absorbed by nucleic acids and proteins in the epi -\\ndermis and stimulates the synthesis of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol). Some \\nUVa is absorbed in the epidermis, but UV a penetrates into the dermis.\\nthe damage caused by UV r depends on the duration of exposure, as \\nwell as the skin phototype (see t able\\xa016.1).\\n• UVB causes immediate sunburn with painful erythema and, if \\nsevere, blistering. t he UVB reaction peaks at 16–  24h, then the skin \\ndesquamates over 2–  3\\xa0days but becomes tanned and may develop \\nsolar lentigines (sunburn freckles).\\n• UVr, particularly UVB, damages DN a, and cumulative damage \\ncauses skin cancer (see E p. 346).\\n• Chronic UV exposure produces many of the signs we associate \\nwith ageing (photodamage)—  wrinkling, blotchy pigmentation, \\ntelangiectasia, a sallow appearance—  as well as skin cancer (see \\nE\\xa0Box 3.1, p. 43).\\n• UVr also causes local and systemic immunosuppression, which not \\nonly leads to problems, such as recurrent herpes simplex infection, \\nbut also contributes to the pathogenesis of skin cancer.\\nHow is the\\xa0skin protected from\\xa0sun damage?\\nNucleotide excision repair enzymes repair photodamaged DN a, but the \\ncapacity to repair declines with age (or may be abnormal in some rare \\nphotogenodermatoses; see E pp. 336–7). Epidermal melanin provides \\nsome UV protection by absorbing visible light, as well as UV r (see\\xa0 E  \\npp. 12–3). Melanin also quenches oxygen free radicals.\\nDarkly pigmented skin has the same number of melanocytes as lightly \\npigmented skin, but more and slightly differently packaged melanin \\n(melanosomes) within keratinocytes provides greater resistance to solar \\ndamage. h owever, even dark skin burns in the sun, if the dose of UV r \\nis high enough.\\nUVa causes immediate darkening of the skin (oxidation of pre-  existing \\nmelanin) that lasts a few hours and is not photoprotective. UVB is the \\nmain stimulus for the delayed tanning detectable\\xa03–  5\\xa0days after exposure \\n(more melanocytes, synthesis of new melanin, redistribution of melano -\\nsomes). this provides some photoprotection and fades slowly.'),\n",

Opaque sunblock creams do not have to be applied very \\nthickly to be effective.\\n• t he sunscreen is not applied evenly to the skin or to all exposed \\nskin, including lips, sides of the neck, ears, and temples.\\n• t he sunscreen is not reapplied every 2–  3h or straight after \\nswimming or activities causing sweating.\\n• Patient allergic to the sunscreen (refer for photopatch testing).\\n• r ecommend physical barriers—  sunglasses, clothing, hats, and \\nshade—  rather than encouraging patients to rely on sunscreens.\\nBox 16.11 Advice on\\xa0optimal vitamin D synthesis\\n• UVB triggers conversion of 7-  dehydrocholesterol in the skin to \\npre- vitamin D.\\xa0a dequate levels of vitamin D are maintained if 15% \\nof the body (face, arms, legs) receives about 1/ 3 of the minimal \\nerythematogenic dose of UVB on most days of the week. In the UK, \\nthis equates to 15min of sun exposure on the arms, legs, and/  or \\nface x3/ week from May to September (during the rest of the year, \\nsunlight at this latitude is insufficient for vitamin D synthesis).\\n• Patients who are very photosensitive and cannot tolerate any UVB \\nradiation should take vitamin D supplements.\\n• Vitamin D supplements may also be needed by individuals living in \\ncountries with low levels of UV for much of the\\xa0year.\\n• Vitamin D deficiency is common in the elderly, people with darker \\nskin, or those who cover the skin when outdoors.'),\n",

Alternative thera -\\npies, including vitamin or herbal supplements, may also cause prob -\\nlems. Reactions may be pharmacological or idiosyncratic (see Box 18.2). \\nPredisposition is probably multifactorial, involving genetic and environ -\\nmental factors (see Box\\xa018.3).\\nAdvances in pharmacogenetics may help to predict which patients are \\nlikely to benefit from, or react adversely to, certain drugs. For example, \\nHL A- B*1502 allele in south-  eastern Asian patients has been correlated \\nwith carbamazepine- induced SJS–  teN; HLA-  A*3101 allele is associated \\nwith carbamazepine-  induced reactions in e uropeans, and genotyping for \\nHLA-  B*5701, which is linked to abacavir hypersensitivity, is used to screen \\nhIV- positive patients prior to starting treatment.\\nCutaneous adverse reactions may not be recognized, if the reaction \\nsimulates a condition such as eczema or if the medication has been taken \\nfor months without problems. t he exanthem of a viral infection looks \\nlike a morbilliform drug reaction, but exanthems are more likely in chil -\\ndren than in adults. t o compound diagnostic difficulties, reactions may \\nnot settle as soon as the drug is withdrawn—  some persist for months— \\nand generally there is no definitive test to confirm the diagnosis of ‘drug \\nreaction’.\\nthese life-  threatening or severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions are \\ndiscussed in more detail elsewhere:\\n• Anaphylaxis and angio-  oedema (see E pp. 104–5).\\n• erythroderma (see E p. 108).\\n• Stevens Johnson syndrome (see E pp. 116–17).\\n• t oxic epidermal necrolysis (see E pp. 116–17).\\n• DReSS (see E pp. 122–3).\\n• AGeP (see E p. 124).\\n• Anticoagulant-  induced purpura fulminans and skin necrosis  \\n(see E pp. 102–3).\\n• Vasculitis (see E pp. 436–9).\\nBox 18.1 What is an\\xa0adverse drug reaction?\\n‘An appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an \\nintervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard \\nfrom future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or \\nalteration of the dosage regimen or withdrawal of the product’.\\nedwards IR and Aronson JK.

Vasculitis may affect ves -\\nsels of different sizes in the skin, kidneys, gut, respiratory tract, periph -\\neral nerves, and/  or skeletal muscle.\\nThe histological findings in vasculitis may include:\\n• p erivascular neutrophilic inflammation extending into vessel\\xa0walls.\\n• Swelling and injury of endothelial\\xa0cells.\\n• Necrosis of vessel\\xa0walls.\\n• Fibrinoid deposition around vessels (fibrinoid necrosis).\\n• e xtravasation of r BCs (clinically evident as purpura in the\\xa0skin).\\n• Nuclear dust, indicative of leukocytoclasis (fragmentation of the \\nnuclei of neutrophils).\\nSymptoms and signs vary, but palpable purpura is the hallmark of a small- \\nvessel cutaneous vasculitis (see Box 20.2, and Figs. 20.1 and\\xa020.2).\\nClinical findings should be integrated with the results of serological, \\npathological, and imaging studies to reach a diagnosis. For classification \\ncriteria, see Box\\xa020.1.\\nWhat is occlusive vasculopathy?\\nVasculitis in the skin must be differentiated from an occlusive vasculopa -\\nthy. Skin biopsy shows that the vessels are occluded, without significant \\nvascular inflammation (see E p. 452 and pp. 312–15).\\nPurpura:\\xa0differential diagnosis\\nSee E\\xa0p. 70.'),\n",

African/  Caribbean patients tend to have more severe manifesta -\\ntions. Skin is affected in 25% of patients.\\nWhat should I\\xa0look\\xa0for?\\nSpecific cutaneous lesions\\nSkin is easier to biopsy to confirm the diagnosis than internal organs, so \\nlook hard for skin signs. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a great imitator. Specific \\ncutaneous lesions have a granulomatous histology (see E Box 33.5,  \\np. 651) and may include:\\n• Asymptomatic translucent yellowish brown firm papules (often \\nperiorbital), nodules, or plaques (round, oval, or annular)  \\n(see Fig. 25.1) on an erythematous background. Smooth or scaly.  \\nMay appear psoriasiform. Diascopy reveals yellow-  brown colour  \\n(see Box 25.2). Usually resolve spontaneously.\\n• Changing scars:\\xa0infiltration gives skin a purplish red colour  \\n(see Fig. 25.2). May be tender. Sarcoid may also involve tattoos.\\n• Firm subcutaneous nodules (Darier–  roussy sarcoid) most often on \\nthe forearms. Often associated with systemic disease.\\n• Lupus pernio:\\xa0indolent reddish purple destructive plaques and \\nnodules on the nose, cheeks, lips, and ears (sites where skin is \\ncool). Commonest in women. Lesions may ulcerate and heal with \\ntelangiectatic scars (see Fig. 25.3). Poor prognosis. Associated with \\nmore severe pulmonary disease. May respond to oral lenalidomide.\\n• Alopecia:\\xa0scarring or non-  scarring.\\n• Ulcers, most often on legs:\\xa0seen most often in African Americans.\\n• Ichthyosis-  like scaling on legs (rarely generalized).\\n• Lichenoid (1–  2%):\\xa0violaceous or yellow/  brown scaly papules on the \\nface, trunk, and limbs. h istology:\\xa0both granulomas and focal basal cell \\ndegeneration.\\n• h ypopigmented macules or patches, or hypopigmentation over \\npapules.\\n• Nail involvement:\\xa0nail plate dystrophy, including pitting, longitudinal \\nridging, opacity, and loss of nail plate. Periungual changes are unusual.\\n• Coarse trabecular bony changes in the distal phalanx are\\xa0rare.\\nNon- specific cutaneous lesions\\n• Erythema nodosum is a ‘reactive’ panniculitis, which tends to \\nbe associated with an acute form of sarcoid. It resolves without \\ntreatment. Löfgren syndrome (EN with bilateral hilar adenopathy, \\nfever, and acute ankle arthritis) is diagnostic of sarcoid (see E p. 458).\\nInvolvement of\\xa0other\\xa0organs\\n• Lungs:\\xa0asymptomatic in 60%. May have cough, dyspnoea, or \\npleuritic chest pain. t en to 30% develop chronic pulmonary disease. \\nPulmonary fibrosis causes respiratory failure.\\n• Eyes:\\xa0blurring or loss of vision, painful red eye, or photophobia.

Some aspects of chronic GVHD share features with other \\nautoimmune diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis, bronchiolitis \\nobliterans, and Sjögren syndrome.\\nPatients should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team that includes \\nophthalmologists, dermatologists, and haematologists. Fifty percent \\nhave limited cutaneous disease and a good prognosis, but the outcome in \\nwidespread chronic cutaneous GVHD is poor (see Box\\xa026.6).\\nWhat should I\\xa0look\\xa0for?\\n• Manifestations vary, and patients often have overlapping patterns of \\ndisease with a combination of lichenoid and sclerodermoid features.\\n• Check hair and nails, as well as skin (see Box\\xa026.4).\\n• e xamine mucosae, including genitalia (see Box\\xa026.5).\\n• Assess joint mobility and impact of disease.\\n• 0 These patients have been exposed to chemotherapy and \\nprolonged immunosuppression and are at risk of cutaneous \\nmalignancies and/  or unusual cutaneous infections (fungal, atypical \\nmycobacterial).\\n• Other organ involvement includes:\\n• GIT causing abdominal symptoms (diarrhoea) and weight\\xa0loss.\\n• Liver with abnormal\\xa0LFTs.\\n• Lungs causing shortness of breath (check lung function tests).\\nWhat should\\xa0I\\xa0do?\\n• Biopsy atypical cutaneous lesions to exclude malignancy/  infection.\\n• e mollients and soap substitutes with antiseptics may reduce itch, \\nimprove the skin barrier, and reduce the risk of infection.\\n• Artificial saliva, topical local anaesthetic gels, and topical corticosteroids \\nare indicated for painful oral disease (see E Box 14.4, p. 283).\\n• Prescribe artificial tears for dry\\xa0eyes.\\n• Lichenoid disease:\\xa0potent corticosteroid ointments or 0.1% \\ntacrolimus ointment bd may reduce inflammation.\\n• Sclerodermoid disease:\\xa0UVB, PUVA, or UVA1 may be helpful in early \\ndisease. e CP may have a role in widespread disease (see Box 26.7). \\neCP may induce antigen-  specific regulatory T-  cells that suppress \\nGVHD, but the mechanisms of action are not\\xa0clear.\\n• The combination of systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive \\nagents is generally used as first-  line treatment. Complications, such as \\ninfection, increase mortality.\\n• Other treatments include mTOR inhibitors, rituximab, and imatinib.\\n More trials are needed.'),\n",

May also be \\ncaused by the contraceptive\\xa0pill.\\n• Itch usually commences around 25–  32 weeks of gestation but \\nclears promptly post-  partum. Worse in twin pregnancies.\\n• Serum bile acids, alkaline phosphatase, and aminotransferases are \\nraised. Jaundice occurs in 10–  25% of patients.\\n• • Associated with placental insufficiency, premature labour, and \\nsudden fetal death. Placental anoxia may be caused by decreased \\nfetal elimination of toxic bile acids.

The psychosocial burden can be profound. Aim to address concerns \\nand to educate (see Box 31.16), so that the child / family have the tools to \\nmanage this distressing chronic disease.\\n• Intractable itch/  scratch. Relieve dryness, and control eczema. \\nProtect skin from damage—  suggest stroking or pinching skin to \\nrelieve itch; use occlusion. Therapeutic stories, in which the child is \\nchampion, may facilitate behavioural change, improve self-  esteem, \\nand help the child engage with treatment (overcoming ‘Evil Eric \\nEczema’).\\n• Complaints that the skin ‘reacts to’/  ‘is allergic to’ emollients. \\nIrritation of inflamed skin is much commoner than allergy. Ointments \\nmay be tolerated less well than creams. Suggest trying a creamy \\nemollient on normal skin for a few days, before applying to \\neczematous skin. Explain that, if normal skin does not react, allergy \\nis unlikely. Control acute eczema with topical corticosteroids or \\ncalcineurin inhibitors, and then apply emollients.\\n• Steroid phobia. Some parents refuse to use ‘bad’ topical steroids  \\n(a misconception that may have been reinforced by other health- \\ncare professionals). Explain the different strengths of steroids and \\nthe proper use of topical steroids (see E p. 610). State the specific \\nquantity of topical corticosteroid you expect to be used over 1 or \\n2\\xa0weeks.\\n• Once eczema is controlled, empower the child and family by \\nintroducing proactive therapy, i.e. low-  dose, intermittent applications \\nof anti-  inflammatory therapy to previously affected skin (‘hot spots’) \\n(see Box 31.17).\\n• ‘he has a food allergy’. Find out exactly what the parent means and \\nwhat has been observed (see Box 31.18). Inappropriate withdrawal \\nof foods may cause nutritional deficiencies. Most children with mild \\neczema do not need investigation for food allergies.\\n• Recurrent 2° bacterial infection (oozing golden-  crusted patches), \\nusually with S.\\xa0aureus . Use antibacterial emollients, e.g. products \\ncontaining benzalkonium chloride and/  or chlorhexidine, to cleanse \\nthe skin and remove crusts. Bleach baths (1/  4 cup of household \\nbleach in a half bathtub of water) for 5–  10min, 2–  3x/ week may \\nreduce bacterial colonization. Treat nasal carriage of S.\\xa0aureus  (child \\nand family) with topical mupiricin. Short courses of oral antibiotics \\nmay be required.\\n• Molluscum contagiosum. May be spread by scratching. Reassure the \\nchild/ parent that molluscum will go, but this may take some time, \\nparticularly if topical steroids are being used. Flares of eczema around \\nmolluscum may herald regression. (Also see E p. 158.)\\n• Attention-  deficit/  hyperactivity disorder (AD hD). Caring for children \\nwith eczema is exhausting. Some are just itchy and active, but others, \\nin particular those with more severe eczema, may have AD hD. \\nConsider referral to a child psychologist.'),\n",

This chapter provides an \\nintroduction to a few of the many single gene disorders affecting the skin, \\nhair, and/ or nails—  the genodermatoses.\\nMonogenic disorders\\nAn understanding of the molecular basis of single-  gene ‘Mendelian’ skin \\ndiseases has provided insights into the structure and function of normal \\nskin, as well as the pathogenesis of some acquired diseases (e.g. autoim -\\nmune blistering diseases; see E Table 13.2, p. 264). For the molecular \\nbasis of some monogenic skin disorders, see Table\\xa032.1.\\nA clinical disorder (phenotype) is dominant when the condition is \\nmanifest in heterozygotes (two different alleles), and recessive when the \\ntrait is only manifest in homozygotes (two identical alleles). AD traits \\nusually involve structural proteins, whereas A r traits commonly involve \\nenzymes. Generally, it is possible to predict the likelihood of disease in \\nmonogenic disorders, based on analysis of the genotype, but some domi -\\nnantly inherited disorders show age-  dependent penetrance (features are \\nnot present at birth but evolve with time), whereas others show incom -\\nplete penetrance (not all those having the mutation develop the disease).\\nGenotype–  phenotype correlation\\nCorrelation can be difficult. Different mutations in a single gene may \\ncause different clinical disorders; mutations in different genes may lead \\nto similar phenotypes (genetic heterogeneity), and the same mutation \\n(genotype) within a family may lead to disorders of different severity (dif -\\nferent expressivity). In a few autosomal dominantly inherited diseases, \\nseverity increases in successive generations (anticipation). Some genes \\nare expressed differently, if inherited from the mother than from the \\nfather (imprinting). Most X-  linked traits are expressed more severely in \\nmen (who are hemizygous) than in\\xa0women.\\nContiguous gene syndromes\\nIf large deletions affect several neighbouring genes, several disorders \\nmay be transmitted together, simulating a monogenic disorder.\\nPolygenic disorders\\nGenome-  wide association studies in large populations have identified \\nmany hundreds of genetic variants (markers) associated with a suscep -\\ntibility to many common genetically complex diseases such as diabetes, \\nautism, psoriasis, and atopic eczema, as well as to physical traits such as \\nheight and pigmentation (colour of skin, hair, and\\xa0eyes).\\nIn contrast to single-  gene disorders, environmental factors and gene– \\ngene interactions (epistasis) play much greater roles in determining the \\nrisk of disease, so it is not possible to predict the likelihood of a complex \\ndisease based solely on the genotype.'),\n",

The outcome is \\na partial phenotype, i.e. only some of the cells express the disease. In ♀, \\nrandom X-  inactivation (lyonization) results in functional X-  chromosome \\nmosaicism.\\nSkin disorders reflecting mosaicism in keratinocytes follow predictable \\npatterns ( blaschko lines) (see Fig. 32.1). Individuals who are mosaic for \\na condition can only transmit the disorder to the next generation (who \\nwill inherit the non-  mosaic form), if the mosaicism also affects cells in the \\ngermline (ovary, testis). Involvement of germline cells is hypothesized to \\nbe more likely in individuals with extensive skin involvement. Mutations \\narising early in development may be associated with widespread abnor -\\nmalities in skin and other organs.\\nFor examples of cutaneous mosaicism, see E pp. 636 –7.\\nWhat are Blaschko\\xa0lines?\\n(see E inside back cover for diagram.)\\nAlfred b laschko was a dermatologist from b erlin who observed that \\nepidermal naevi and some acquired skin diseases followed similar pat -\\nterns:\\xa0linear on the limbs, arcs on the chest, S-  shapes on the abdomen, \\nor V- shapes near the midline of the back. The patterns were not related \\nto dermatomes (segments of skin defined by sensory innervations) or \\nany known cause of linear skin markings such as Langer lines of cleavage, \\naxial lines separating cranial and caudal dermatomes, lymphatic drainage, \\nvascular flow, embryonic clefts, or pigmentary demarcation lines (see E \\npp. 62–3). The lines probably reflect keratinocyte mosaicism and cor -\\nrespond to the pathways followed by keratinocytes migrating from the \\nneural crest during embryogenesis.\\nHow do I\\xa0recognize cutaneous mosaicism?\\nFive patterns have been described (see Fig. 32.1). The pattern is influ -\\nenced by the pathway of migration of the affected cell, as well as other \\nfactors such as the timing of the mutation:\\n• k eratinocyte:\\xa0b laschko-  linear pattern. Each clone of keratinocytes \\nforms a continuous line, as the cells migrate outwards by directional \\nproliferation following surface forces.\\n• Melanoblast:\\xa0block or phylloid but may be b laschko-  linear patterns. \\nMelanoblasts migrate as single cells and proliferate locally in\\xa0skin.\\n• Nerve cells:\\xa0dermatomal. Nerve cells migrate along future \\ndermatomes.\\n• Mesodermal tissues (blood vessels, fibroblasts):\\xa0segmental or \\ndermatomal. Cells migrate within segments or dermatomes.'),\n",

       "\"**Report for [Patient's Name]**\\n\\nI've reviewed the results of our skin lesion analysis, and I'd like to explain what we found.\\n\\nThe detected skin lesion is a **Melanocytic Nevus**, which is a type of benign growth. A Melanocytic Nevus is a common condition where a mole or patch of skin grows in an abnormal shape and color. Don't worry; most Melanocytic Nevi are harmless and don't require treatment.\\n\\nThe model's confidence score of 92.4% indicates that our analysis was very accurate. This means the model was able to identify the lesion as a Melanocytic Nevus with high reliability.\\n\\nNow, let's take a closer look at the **Grad-CAM/Heatmap** provided. The model focused on two key areas: **pigmentation irregularities** and **shape abnormalities**. These regions are important because they help us understand how the skin lesion differs from surrounding healthy tissue.\\n\\nThe highlighted image regions show where the skin lesion is most different in color and shape compared to normal skin. This is crucial information for identifying the type of Melanocytic Nevus we're dealing with.\\n\\nWhile a Melanocytic Nevus itself isn't typically a cause for concern, it's essential to monitor its growth or change over time. We recommend regular follow-ups with your primary care physician or dermatologist to ensure there are no signs of unusual growth or spreading.\\n\\n**Please note that only a qualified medical professional can provide personalized advice and treatment. I strongly encourage you to schedule an appointment with your doctor for further evaluation and guidance.**\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask.\""
